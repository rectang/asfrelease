ASF Release Policy codification proposal
========================================

At the "[Community Panel: Release Cadence and Apache
Releases](http://sched.co/1fPF9UT)" during ApacheCon North America 2014,
strong support was expressed for migrating Apache release policy documentation
from FAQ-style to imperative style.

This repository captures proposed modifications to the policy documentation as
a sequence of changesets.
